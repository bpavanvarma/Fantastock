### Motivation:

   Drawing inspiration from fantasy gaming and the ever-growing interest in the stock market, we plan to build a Fantasy Trading application. Though the financial sector is actively embracing technological innovation, many are still not comfortable with the idea of investing in equities because of the volatility in the market trend. The idea of fantasy trading is to introduce the users to the world of trading by negating the risk. 

   Keeping in mind the correlation of sports and stocks when it comes to uncertainty, we have decided to extend the concept of fantasy sports in the financial sector too. Within the fantasy sports framework, the stock market investments can be stimulated by improving the chances for success in real world scenarios.
 
### Description:

   This fantasy stock trading application attempts to simulate the real-world conditions. With this application users will become more familiar with the nuts and bolts of finance and the fundamentals of Investing. This application could be a stepping stone for the amateurs. Even experienced investors benefit by understanding different factors that play a role in stock market trends like the market sentiment.

   Without the brokerage involved, we can provide users significant information about trading. It can help them figure out the costs involved when settling on purchasing decisions. We aim to democratize finance through technology. We want to give aspiring investors the platform they need to hone their skills and grow their confidence.

### How is our application different? (Includes the Future Purposes)

   Compared to previous applications, we have planned to focus on both the stock market as well as digital currencies. Financial and business news plays a key role in fluctuating the market trends. Policies by governments across the world also sway the stock prices, understanding them is vital in predicting them. And we plan on providing this information on the dashboard of premium users. We also plan to provide the trending stock to users based on trends in social media.
